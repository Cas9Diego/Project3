        let path = Bundle.main.resourcePath! //This constant sets the resoure path of our apps bundle. A bundle is a directory containing our compiled program and all our assets, so this constant says "Tell me where I can find all the images that I added". The EXCLAMATION MARK is necessary because our main bundle may not have a resource path, because some app bundles dont have a resource path. However, iOS main bundles always have a resource path, so it is ok to do forced unwrapping
        let items = try! fm.contentsOfDirectory(atPath: path) // this variable is set to the content of the directory at a path, which path? the one we defined before. Basicaly, we say "USe the filemanager to read the documents at a certain path, the path we signaled".
